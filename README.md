# navarch-568-proj

## Setup
1. Install MATLAB.
2. Clone this repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:audrow/navarch-568-proj.git WORKSPACE_DIR
```
3. Run `src/run.m` from the repositories home directory. This run will show you several figures including the path from visual odometry, proposed loop closures, the map after the loop closures, and the error between the final map and ground truth.

To reproduce our results in the presentation and report, download the full [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) and run sequence zero.
